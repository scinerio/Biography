                        Welcome! My name is Jason Williams; I'm a young professional in the information security field with the goal of becoming the biggest "know-it-all" there is. Before college, I was a band geek that was so invested in music that I nearly went to school to major in it. Though my decision changed, it is still one of my passions, and I still play piano in my spare time. My current career goal is to pass the CISSP exam by the end of Summer 2019, and then continue pwning machines on HackTheBox.eu until I think I'm ready to start preparing to be an Offensive Security Certified Professonal (OSCP).

                <h3>Defense Point Security</h3>
                <h4>Junior Cyber Defense Analyst</h4>
                <p>
                    This position involved the use of numerous network monitoring tools to review and respond to various alerts for our clients. All of our clients had a Splunk instance that would be used to triage potential incidents, and other clients had additional security tools like RSA Netwitness and FireEye AX/HX/NX. A usual day at DPS could involve detecting and responding to DoS/DDoS attacks, determining if an endpoint has malware, or investigating ongoing phishing campaigns against our customers. Most notable alerts would require the creation of a report and actionable remediation tactics.

                <h4>Associate Information Security Analyst</h4>
                <p>
                    My role at TraceSecurity was to provide various cybersecurity services to a client-base predominately in the financial sector. This team would assist clients with security awareness by performing social engineering and phishing campaigns as well as assigning post-test training through a web application. We assisted clients with installing and using TraceSecurity's proprietary vulnerability scanning software. If a customer had an online presence, we would conduct penetration tests against external systems to look for vulnerabilities in the applications. Lastly, we would provide clients with a policy review to ensure that they were ISO-compliant.

                <h4>Senior Technical Support Operator</h4>
                <p>
                    Located on LSU's campus, the LEO helpdesk provided an early opportunity for students to break into the IT field. Technical Support Operators at LEO would assist various law enforcement personnel such as the FBI, DHS, and even local police. The main duties of this position were to provide account administration and hardware/software support through a 24/7 support line. After a year of employment, I was promoted to the senior position and received additional responsibilities such as providing training, reviewing metrics and tickets, and conducting meetings for my own team of operators.

                My degree at Louisiana State University had a concentration in data science and analytics, and my GPA was a 3.4 by graduation. I took a variety of electives to round myself out. The two cybersecurity courses I took ultimately drove me to pursue it as a career.

We even thought about security </b>before</b> production, implementing a PIN authentation as well as challenge questions.

                            In a course titled "Programming Digital Media," I created a web-based Javascript application that tests the brain by coloring a word like "brown" or "yellow" with an entirely different color, and the player had to select the button on a controller that was the colored with the color of the word, not the fill color. The controller was made with an Arduino, the graphics were made with Tone.js API, and the music was made using the Tone.js API.
