                        Hello! My name is Jason Williams, and I'm an early profession in the Information Security field that wants to be a "big shot" in the field one day. My passion for the field spawned from my first infosec job at TraceSecurity. Because of TraceSecurity, I self-studied to become a Security+ CE right before I graduated. Just less than a year after graduating, I decided to step my game up and take the CISSP exam, becoming an Associate of (ISC)2 until I meet the experience requirements. My next step is to become more well-versed in Offensive Security-- so I'm diving into as many machines as I can on hackthebox.eu until I feel that I'm ready for the OSCP. Having an offensive mindset is, in my opinion, one of the most valuable traits one could have in the field-- so I look forward to wearing a white hat soon.

                <h3>First Information Technology Services</h3>
                <h4>Information Security Analyst</h4>
                <p>
                    My role at FITS was to support the FedRAMP certification for Microsoft Azure. FedRAMP is a compliance framework for Cloud Service Providers that want their services to be utilized by government entities. The specific team I worked on operated the "Continuous Monitoring" process, which requires CSPs to scan assets on a monthly basis and report the findings as POA&Ms. Additionally, I utilized my Computer Science background to help automate redundant and time-consuming tasks to help coworkers spend time where it's more needed. I recently wrote (but cannot share) a Python application that utilizes the Azure DevOps Rest API and creates a large list of work items based on variable data.

                <h4>Junior Cyber Defense Analyst</h4>
                <p>
                    This position involved the use of numerous network monitoring tools to review and respond to various alerts for our clients. All of our clients had a Splunk instance that would be used to triage potential incidents, and other clients had additional security tools like RSA Netwitness and FireEye AX/HX/NX. A usual day at DPS could involve detecting and responding to DoS/DDoS attacks, determining if an endpoint has malware, or investigating ongoing phishing campaigns against our customers. Most notable alerts would require the creation of a report and actionable remediation tactics.

                <p>
                    My role at TraceSecurity was to provide various cybersecurity services to a client-base predominately in the financial sector. This team would assist clients with security awareness by performing social engineering and phishing campaigns as well as assigning post-test training through a web application. We assisted clients with installing and using TraceSecurity's proprietary vulnerability scanning software. If a customer had an online presence, we would conduct penetration tests against external systems to look for vulnerabilities in the applications. Lastly, we would provide clients with a policy review to ensure that they were ISO-compliant.

                    Located on LSU's campus, the LEO helpdesk provided an early opportunity for students to break into the IT field. Technical Support Operators at LEO would assist various law enforcement personnel such as the FBI, DHS, and even local police. The main duties of this position were to provide account administration and hardware/software support through a 24/7 support line. After a year of employment, I was promoted to the senior position and received additional responsibilities such as providing training, reviewing metrics and tickets, and conducting meetings for my own team of operators.

                            In a course titled "Programming Digital Media," I created a web-based Javascript application that tests the brain by coloring a word like "brown" or "yellow" with an entirely different color, and the player had to select the button on a controller that was the colored with the color of the word, not the fill color. The controller was made with an Arduino, the graphics were made with Tone.js API, and the music was made using the Tone.js API.
