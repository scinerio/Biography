                        Hi, welcome to my portfolio website! I'm a passionate information security professional with a growing interesting in penetration testing, application security, and cloud technologies. My highest priority is to continuously grow in the field and work towards gaining knowledge in the areas previously mentioned (all through it doesn't stop with those). Hopefully my growing list of certifications can serve as evidence of my love for the field. Anyway, thanks for stopping by and hope to hear from you if you have any roles that I might be a good fit for.

                <h3>First Information Technology Services</h3>
                <h4>Information Security Analyst</h4>
                <p>
                    My role at FITS has been varying over time. The first few months were spent reviewing the vulnerability scan findings for Microsoft's entire Azure team (so many scans!). More specifically, I would write deviation requests that Azure would provide to FedRAMP to provide a clear indication of whether of not a scan finding is legitimate, scored properly, or unfixable by Azure (i.e. the vendor has not provided patches).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this, I was the technical lead for a six month long technical privacy assessment of Microsoft Office products to identify any areas where personal data or the controls around it behaved unexpectedly. This project required knowledge of how to capture and review network traffic from iOS, Androd, Windows, and MacOS devices. Additional efforts were spent using automation tools (python and bash tools mostly) to sift through ~100 GB of telemetry data to ensure no personal data was colleted beyond the restrictions set in the Office Administration settings. The NDA prevents the findings from being shared, but Microsoft's engineering teams responded very quickly to any potential issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With my growing interest in penetration testing, I began self studying to meet the requirements to perform penetration tests on the FITS 3PAO team, acquiring the OSCP and GMOB certifications within about 6 months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we don't have penetration tests queued up for me full time, I've been working as a Cloud Security Engineer for a FedRAMP cloud in Azure that we manage for Software AG Government. I've provided useful security alerts and dashboards to ensure that we have a high level of insight of potential threats to the environment. I'm also responsible for monthly vulnerability scanning and remediation, as well as providing guidance for cloud administration decisions from an offensive security perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    P.S. My explicit interest in becoming a security expert was obvious enough to FITS that I was promoted up two levels at once to match the skills I acquired in just one year.

                <h4>Junior Cyber Defense Analyst</h4>
                <p>
                    This position involved the use of numerous network monitoring tools to review and respond to various alerts for our clients. All of our clients had a Splunk instance that would be used to triage potential incidents, and other clients had additional security tools like RSA Netwitness and FireEye AX/HX/NX. A usual day at DPS could involve detecting and responding to DoS/DDoS attacks, determining if an endpoint has malware, or investigating ongoing phishing campaigns against our customers. Most notable alerts would require the creation of a report and actionable remediation tactics.

                <p>
                    My role at TraceSecurity was to provide various cybersecurity services to a client-base predominantly in the financial sector. This team would assist clients with security awareness by performing social engineering and phishing campaigns as well as assigning post-test training through a web application. We assisted clients with installing and using TraceSecurity's proprietary vulnerability scanning software. If a customer had an online presence, we would conduct penetration tests against external systems to look for vulnerabilities in the applications. Lastly, we would provide clients with a policy review to ensure that they were ISO-compliant.

                <h4>Senior Technical Support Operator</h4>
                <p>
                    Located on LSU's campus, the LEO helpdesk provided an early opportunity for students to break into the IT field. Technical Support Operators at LEO would assist various law enforcement personnel such as the FBI, DHS, and even local police. The main duties of this position were to provide account administration and hardware/software support through a 24/7 support line. After a year of employment, I was promoted to the senior position and received additional responsibilities such as providing training, reviewing metrics and tickets, and conducting meetings for my own team of operators.

We even thought about security </b>before</b> production, implementing a PIN authentication  as well as challenge questions.

                            In a course titled "Programming Digital Media," I created a web-based Javascript application that tests the brain by coloring a word like "brown" or "yellow" with an entirely different color, and the player had to select the button on a hand-made arduino controller that was the color with the color of the word, not the color that it's filled with. The controller was made with an Arduino, the graphics were made with Tone.js API, and the music was made using the Tone.js API.
